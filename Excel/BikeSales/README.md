## BIKE SALES DASHBOARD

### PROJECT GOAL:
In this excel project the main tasks focused on were data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, and data analysis.

### STEPS TAKEN:

#### PREPARING + CLEANING DATA:
1. Checked for and removed duplicate data.
2. Reformatted the ‘Marital Status’ column to expand the abbreviated words using IF statements.
3. Reformatted the ‘Gender’ column to expand the abbreviated words using IF statements.
4. Reformatted the 'Income' column from that of a general number format to an accounting number format.
5. Changed the value of '+10 Miles' to 'Over 10 Miles' in the 'Commute Distance' column.
6. Added a new column 'Age Brackets' to categorize the values from the 'Age' column.
8.	Converted the range of data into a table, as well as changed the table name and table style.

#### PIVOT TABLE:
1. Created a pivot table to showcase the average income both purchasing and non-purchasing customers, and displayed it using a bar graph.
2. Created a pivot table to showcase the average commute distance of both purchasing and non-purchasing customers, and displayed it using a line graph.
3. Created a pivot table to showcase the distribution of age brackets of both purchasing and non-purchasing customers, and displayed it using a line graph.
4. Added slicers to filter on 'Marital Status', 'Region' and/or 'Education'


#### DATA VISUALIZATION:
1. Created a dashboard using the graphs created earlier.
2. Added a header and edited the layout.
3. Linked the slicers together so that all graphs will filter accordingly.

### CONCLUSION:
From the given data we can draw many conclusions as to the sales of bikes.

1. Overall, for both males and females,the average income of those who purchased bikes compared to those who didn't was higher. This was also the case for both genders in all regions, except for Europe in which the income of females who didn't purchase bikes was slightly higher than that of those females who did purchase.

2. Middle aged people (31-54 years old) made up most of the customer list. This age bracket were more likely to purchase a bike than not doing so, when compared to the adolescent and old age brackets. This could suggest that the company could focus more of its efforts towards the middle aged bracket.

3. Customers with a commute distance of between either 0-1 miles or 2-5 miles were more likely to purchase a bike. This could suggest that consumers were more likely to use their bikes for shorter distances.
