## JOBS IN DATA DASHBOARD

### PROJECT GOAL:
In this excel project the main tasks focused on were data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, and data analysis.

### STEPS TAKEN:

#### PREPARING + CLEANING DATA:
1. Did not search for duplicates as removing any duplicate data may cause a loss of data. This is due to the absence of any uniquely identifying piece of data in each row.
2. Reformatted the ‘company_size’ column to expand the abbreviated words using IF statements, and added this to a new column ‘company_size_full’.

#### PIVOT TABLE:
1. Created pivot table 'AvgSalaryByJob' from the data table, and created a custom formatted bar graph from this pivot table to show the average salary by job category.
2. Created pivot table 'MaxSalaryByJob' from the data table, and created a custom formatted bar graph from this pivot table to show the maximum salary by job category.
3. Created pivot table 'MinSalaryByJob' from the data table, and created a custom formatted bar graph from this pivot table to show the minimum salary by job category.
4. Created pivot table 'AvgSalaryByCompSize' from the data table, and created a custom formatted bar graph from this pivot table to show the average salary by company.
5. Added custom created slicers to filter on 'Company Location', 'Experience Level', 'Employment Type' and/or 'Work Setting'.

#### DATA VISUALIZATION:
1.	Created a dashboard using the graphs that were created earlier.
2.	Added a header and edited the layout.
3.	Linked the slicers together so that all graphs will filter accordingly.

### CONCLUSION:
From the given data we can draw many conclusions as to the jobs in data.

1. 'Machine Learning' had the highest average salary, whereas 'Data Quality and Operations' had the lowest.

2. Medium sized companies offered the highest average salaries. This may come as a surprise, as larger companies would've been expected to offer higher average salaries due to being more large scale.

3. The lowest minimum salaries were jobs in 'BI and Visualization', 'Data Analysis', and 'Machine Learning and AI'. When further analyzing this data, the minimum salaries for both 'Data Analysis' and 'Machine Learning and AI' were entry-level jobs. However, the minimum salary for 'BI and Visualization' was a mid-level job.

4. The highest maximum salary was a job in 'Data Science and Research'. When further analyzing this data, the maximum salary for 'Data ScienceI' was a mid-level job.
