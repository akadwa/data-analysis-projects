- Explore and clean the data
- Analyze the data to get useful insights
- Present the data in terms of reports or dashboards using visualization

### Business Problem
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report

### HYPOTHESIS
1. More cancellations occur when the prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list then customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of customers are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations

### ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS (FROM DATA ANALYSIS)
1. Even though the percentage of cancellations (37%) is higher than the percentage of non-cancellations (63%), it is still significantly high and has had a major impact on both hotels' earnings.
2. The City Hotel had much more bookings compared to the Resort Hotel. This was due to the fact that the City Hotel was much cheaper. Weekends and holidays may also see an increase in Resort Hotel prices, hence the preference for a cheaper alternative, the City Hotel.
3. The number of confirmed reservations are largest in the month of August, whereas the number of cancelled reservations are largest in the month of January.
4. Cancellations were most common when the prices were at its highest, and were least common when at their lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation was solely responsible for cancellations.
5. Around 46% of customers come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of customers book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

### SUGGESTIONS
1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the customers.
2. As the ration of the cancellation and non-cancellation is higher in the Resort Hotel than the City Hotel, the City Hotel should provide a reasonable discount on the prices during the weekends and holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellations is at its highest during this month.
4. Quality and services can be improved for the hotels especially in Portugal in order to reduce the cancellation rates, as this was the country with the most cancellations.
